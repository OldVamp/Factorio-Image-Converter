# Factorio Image Converter
This is a tool for the game Factorio available at https://www.factorio.com/

It can be used on Images painted in the Factorio tile colors to create LUA scripts that draw the image on the Factorio world map. It looks for exact colors so use hard edge brushes with no aliasing when painting. I have included 2 color pallets as .png files from which you can select the 0.14 game tile colors.

Any new tiles that are added to the game can be added by editing tilecolors.txt after the program has been compiled.
